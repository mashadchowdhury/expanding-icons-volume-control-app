# Volume Control App with Expanding Icons
This is an app developed by me, that has a volume controller which lets the user choose a volume; the music then sets to the volume selected by the user. 

This program also uses the Human Interaction Interaction technique called Expanding Targets, which is where the target (volume icon) gets bigger as the user's mouse gets closer and closer to it.
